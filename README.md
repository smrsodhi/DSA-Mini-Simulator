# DSA-Mini-Simulator

Welcome to my DSA Mini-Simulator! This repository contains five components that showcase various Data Structures and Algorithms concepts. Each component is a standalone application that you can run independently to explore and visualise the corresponding algorithm.

### Sudoku Solver
The Sudoku Solver component allows you to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and solves it using the standard backtracking algorithm.

### Shortest Path Finder
The Shortest Path Finder component demonstrates the popular Dijkstra's algorithm. You'll have a grid to start with and fixed starting and ending nodes. You can click on or drag through nodes to build walls through which the shortest path finder won't be able to move. Click on 'Visualise Dijkstra' and watch.

### Tic Tac Toe
The Tic Tac Toe component lets you play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent. The AI is implemented using the minimax algorithm, ensuring a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.

### N-Queens Visualiser
The N-Queens Visualiser component allows you to visualise the famous N-Queens problem. You can input the number of queens and see how the algorithm places them on the chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Watch how the algorithm smartly explores different possibilities and finds valid solutions.

### Binary Tree Visualiser
The Binary Tree Visualiser component helps you understand the structure of binary trees. Input tree elements in the form of an array and choose between 3 types of binary trees - Complete Binary Tree, Binary Max Heap and Binary Search Tree.
